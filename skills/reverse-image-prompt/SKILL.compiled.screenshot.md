name: reverse-image-prompt
description: Reverse engineer a standalone English text-to-image prompt from a provided image using visible evidence, routed subject/medium/relationship modules, and an adaptive model-aware output contract. Use for faithful reconstruction, semantic prompt extraction, polished-but-composition-faithful variants, diagnostic image analysis, negative prompts, or generation settings.

# Reverse Image Prompt

## Purpose

Turn one provided image into a standalone text-to-image prompt that preserves its primary perceptual proposition: the visible concept or appeal that makes the image itself rather than merely a collection of matching objects. Preserve the source-specific composition, form, surface, light, hierarchy, crop, subject, pose, major-component relationships, color, medium, and meaningful artifacts that causally create that proposition.

Default to **faithful** reconstruction. Preserve awkward, soft, cropped, partial, compressed, or mixed-media evidence instead of silently beautifying or completing it.

## Intent mode

Infer one mode from the request. Ask only when the modes would materially change the result and intent is genuinely unclear.

- `faithful` (default): preserve visible composition, relationships, and imperfections.
- `semantic`: extract the transferable concept, composition, and style without incidental defects.
- `polished-fidelity`: preserve concept and composition while removing only defects the user asks to improve.
- `diagnostic`: explain the evidence, uncertainties, and likely reproduction limits instead of pretending to provide a production-ready prompt.

## Required module loading

Always read the complete Tier 0 core:

- `modules/core.visual-evidence.md`
- `modules/core.frame-coordinates.md`
- `modules/concept.primary-relationship.md`
- `modules/core.fidelity-discipline.md`
- `modules/core.background-color.md`
- `modules/core.pre-emit-gate.md`
- `modules/core.output-contract.md`

Then resolve only the applicable routed modules from `manifest.json` or `modules/_registry.md`. When tools are available, run `tools/route_resolver.py` so unsupported facet values and over-budget routes fail visibly.

Read the full contents of every selected module before drafting. If sibling files cannot be read, use the smallest matching compiled profile; use `SKILL.compiled.all.md` only as the final fallback.

If the target generator is known, read `references/model-adapters.md` and apply only that generator's adapter.

When evaluating or revising this skill, also read `references/behavior-evaluation.md`. Do not load that evaluation protocol for an ordinary one-image prompt request.

## Workflow

1. Inspect only the provided image.
   - Use the attached image directly or inspect the exact local file.
   - If no image is available, ask for it.
   - Process multiple images independently unless the user clearly requests a combined prompt.

2. Use visible evidence only.
   - Do not identify people, characters, brands, artists, cameras, lenses, film stocks, or private identities from appearance.
   - Keep uncertainty internal during analysis. In the final generation prompt, describe the visible ambiguity itself with terms such as `indistinct`, `partially obscured`, `low-legibility`, or `soft-edged`; avoid weakening commands with repeated `likely` or `appears`.

3. Analyze silently with an adaptive hierarchy:
   1. Record the direct, source-supported appeal separately from the render contract. State it plainly in diagnostic mode, but do not copy evaluative appeal language into a generation prompt; translate it into visible causal controls first.
   2. Classify the dominant fidelity axis as `relationship-led`, `appearance-led`, `information-led`, or `mixed`.
   3. Separate a small set of aesthetic or structural invariants from dimensions that may vary without losing the proposition. For each invariant, record its semantic slot, hierarchy role, causal origin, source-relative strength, evidence, and one clause owner. Record the smallest causal cue set rather than every visible field.
   4. Lock frame ratio, crop, subject scale, major zones, boundary sides, and edge interactions.
   5. Map the few largest coherent image regions by relative area, tonal role, edge contact, legibility, and attention. For relationship-led or mixed images, map major-component topology, contact/support, containment, boundary crossing, occlusion, and negative space. For appearance-led images, map form, surface, light-to-form, color, material roles, and subject/environment hierarchy first. For information-led images, map layout, reading order, legibility, and container hierarchy first.
   6. Analyze visible subjects and their image-plane roles. Use a compact broad person-gestalt anchor only when it materially reduces ambiguity; decompose salient human form or appearance into visible causes.
   7. Before treating shape, scale, color, surface, or definition as intrinsic, separate effects caused by pose/deformation, perspective, lighting/shadow, material interaction or occlusion, and capture/processing.
   8. When color or tonal behavior is material, build the source-relative Color/Tone Contract from `detail.color-tone-fidelity`: separate region value, chroma, and hue from illumination, global cast or palette shift, exposure or tone curve, and processing; record neutral-anchor confidence and cross-layer aggregate effects.
   9. Add only materially important pose, camera/perspective, focus, lighting, background, medium, texture, artifact, UI, and text evidence.

   Use this sparse internal map; leave irrelevant fields empty rather than completing a checklist:

```yaml
direct_appeal_read: ""  # diagnostic explanation only; never copied verbatim into render instructions
render_contract:
  mode: relationship-led | appearance-led | information-led | mixed
  perceptual_proposition: ""
  invariants:
    - id: ""
      axis: form | surface | light-to-form | color | sharpness | hierarchy | topology | information
      role: primary | supporting
      observation: ""
      causal_origin: intrinsic | pose-deformation | perspective | lighting-shadow | material-interaction | processing | spatial-relation | layout
      target_strength: subtle | moderate | strong
      source_evidence: []
      clause_owner: ""
  flexible_dimensions: []
  major_regions: []     # relative area, tonal/material role, edge contact, legibility, attention
  candidate_claims: []  # evidence candidates from modules; not automatic prompt sentences
  color_tone_contract: {}  # only when color/tone is materially fidelity-bearing
```

4. Build and resolve this internal facet map:

```yaml
detected_facets:
  subjects: []        # human, animal, product, food, architecture, landscape, vehicle, document/data, generic-object
  medium: []          # photographic, screenshot-ui, non-photographic, unspecified
  relationships: []   # ordinary, occlusion, replacement, reflection, screen-frame-within-frame, scale-miniature, mixed-media
  capture_quality: [] # low-quality, compressed, underexposed, motion-blurred, flash, casual-phone
  detail_risks: []    # face-detail, body-form, body-proportion, muscle-definition, body-tension, skin-surface, body-region-hierarchy, color-tone, color-fidelity, tone-fidelity, surface-color, global-cast, white-balance, exposure-tone, palette-relationship, clothing, hands, text-logo, ui, small-props, cropped-edges, tight-selfie, face-hand-gesture, accessory-torso-budget
  style: []           # stylized-character-maturity or another narrow risk
```

5. Treat selected modules as evidence contributors, not prose entitlements. Merge candidate claims by semantic slot before drafting; one module owns each emitted slot while other modules may strengthen its evidence. For material color and tone, also merge claims by shared perceptual effect across intrinsic surface, illumination, global cast, exposure, processing, and hierarchy even when their semantic-slot names differ. Resolve conflicts and allocate prompt weight using this priority:
   1. Visible-evidence and safety limits.
   2. Primary perceptual proposition, dominant fidelity axis, and invariants.
   3. The mode-leading evidence: topology for relationship-led, causal appearance signature for appearance-led, information hierarchy for information-led, or the named co-primary pair for mixed.
   4. Frame ratio, crop, major zones, boundary sides, visibility, and completion budgets.
   5. Subject, medium, camera, lighting, focus, artifact, background, and color fidelity that supports the proposition.
   6. Flexible pose or placement detail, secondary elements, and generic shorthand.

6. Draft the smallest prompt that carries every invariant and concept-critical constraint. Let its order follow the dominant fidelity axis. If the source look is high-salience, place one compact Aesthetic Causal Signature near the beginning; if neutral, use only one or two ordinary cues. Translate broad appeal words into form, surface, light, color, hierarchy, or spatial mechanisms. Normally express a semantic slot once and add at most one source-supported drift boundary for a genuinely high-risk failure. For material color or tone, assign every emitted direction to one causal layer and one aggregate effect budget; do not let hierarchy repeat a surface hue unless hue contrast is itself invariant. Correct an overstrong draft by replacing or deleting the amplifying language, not by appending a negative counterweight. Give each major component one relation and each inversion-prone interaction one relation clause, but do not let flexible pose coordinates or secondary details outrank the primary proposition.

7. Apply the pre-emit gate and report prompt-only limits honestly.

## Routing rules

- Always load Tier 0.
- Select at least one subject and one medium; use the generic/unspecified fallbacks only when evidence is unclear.
- Load every visible Tier 1 relationship module, including both photographic and non-photographic medium modules for genuine mixed media.
- Load Tier 3 and Tier 4 modules only for visible, material risks.
- For a prominent or clearly readable human face, add `face-detail`; for a small, blurred, shadowed, or heavily occluded face, keep only scale-appropriate human evidence and do not invent micro-features.
- Add a human body-form risk only when visible proportion, contour/tissue, muscle definition, skin surface, tension, or body-region hierarchy is first-order. Do not route it merely because a person or torso is visible.
- Add `detail.color-tone-fidelity` only when color or tonal behavior is first-order, the user explicitly prioritizes tone fidelity, or confusion among intrinsic color, illumination, cast, exposure, and processing would materially change the image. Do not route it for ordinary incidental color.
- Treat the spatial topology of major components as Tier 0 evidence, but let the dominant fidelity axis determine its prompt weight. Do not force ordinary topology to outrank appearance or information invariants.
- Treat adaptive aesthetic analysis as Tier 0 evidence, not as a style preset. Do not load extra style modules merely to fill an aesthetic checklist.
- Module selection controls what must be checked, not how many words it receives. A routed detail module may contribute no standalone sentence when its evidence is already owned by a primary invariant.
- Keep the normal route within 3-8 non-core modules. Refine an over-budget facet map instead of loading every plausible module.
- Treat `ordinary`, `cropped-edges`, and `small-props` as core-handled observations unless another visible risk requires a dedicated module.
- Do not use broad labels such as `cinematic`, `studio`, `luxury`, `beauty shot`, or `high quality` when they would normalize source-specific evidence.

## Output selection

Always write the production prompt in English. Match the response language for diagnostic explanation unless the user asks otherwise.

- Always emit `PROMPT:` for generation requests.
- Emit `NEGATIVE PROMPT:` only when the user requests it or the named downstream generator supports a separate negative prompt.
- Emit `RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:` only when requested, when a target generator is known, or when source dimensions require a model-specific target-size explanation.
- For `diagnostic` mode, first name the visible core appeal or perceptual proposition directly, then explain the causal form, surface, lighting, color, hierarchy, spatial, and capture evidence. Distinguish invariants from pose or placement differences that would not destroy the aesthetic. Include a candidate prompt only if useful.
- Keep the direct appeal reading in the explanation layer. A production prompt receives only its source-supported causal translation, never unbounded evaluative intensifiers copied from the diagnosis.
- Essential crop, relationship, occlusion, high-salience aesthetic, and medium constraints must remain in `PROMPT:` even when optional sections are present.

Do not mention the attached/reference image inside the generated prompt.

# Compiled module bundle

The following module files were appended for runtimes that cannot read sibling files dynamically.



---

# Included module: `core.visual-evidence`

# Core: visual evidence

## When to load

Always.

## Rules

- Never refer to the source image in the final prompt. The prompt must remain usable after the image is removed.
- Describe visible evidence only; do not invent hidden structure or context.
- Do not assert identity, nationality, exact ethnicity, religion, personality, measurements, metadata, brands, artists, cameras, lenses, or film stocks from appearance. When `subject.human` permits one broad racial, ethnic, regional-appearance, or attractiveness category as a generation-oriented visual prior, treat it as a non-identifying approximation rather than a factual identity claim.
- Distinguish absence from uncertainty. Use `absent` only when the frame supports it; otherwise use visual descriptions such as `hidden`, `cropped out`, `indistinct`, `shadow-obscured`, or `low-legibility`.
- Keep epistemic qualifiers in analysis. In the final prompt, describe the visible ambiguity rather than repeatedly saying `appears`, `likely`, or `possibly`.
- In `faithful` mode, preserve visible softness, compression, blur, exposure problems, asymmetry, awkward crop, partial elements, and edge artifacts.
- In `semantic` mode, retain concept-defining imperfections but omit incidental capture defects.
- In `polished-fidelity` mode, improve only the dimensions requested by the user; do not silently alter crop, pose, relationships, identity-relevant appearance, or geometry.
- Give partial elements a visibility budget: what remains visible, how large it is, where it touches the frame, and whether it stays secondary or low-detail.
- Do not complete hidden anatomy, objects, clothing, text, reflections, or background fragments.
- Before treating an observed contour, scale, color, surface, or definition as intrinsic, separate effects caused by pose or deformation, perspective, lighting or shadow, material interaction or occlusion, and capture or processing. Preserve the visible result while assigning each prompt control to the most plausible visible cause.

## Prompt contribution

Put the fidelity ceiling near the beginning only when it materially defines the image. State partial or incomplete evidence affirmatively: `only a narrow cropped strip remains visible`, `the lower half stays outside the frame`, or `the text remains small and indistinct`.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject only likely evidence drift: invented hidden content, completed crops, cleaner relighting, upgraded sharpness, or aesthetic normalization.


---

# Included module: `core.frame-coordinates`

# Core: frame, crop, and spatial anchors

## When to load

Always.

## Source frame

- Inspect the exact file dimensions when available and record them internally as source metadata.
- Treat aspect-ratio drift as a major fidelity failure.
- Separate source dimensions from the requested target size. Never assume the source pixel dimensions are accepted by the target generator.
- Preserve the measured ratio in plain language such as `narrow portrait`, `wide landscape`, or `source-specific portrait ratio`; add a decimal ratio only when it helps distinguish nearby shapes.
- Do not invent exact dimensions from a viewer preview.
- Put frame shape, crop, subject scale, and edge interactions before small object detail.
- Lock subject frame share and negative-space share before adding face or object micro-detail.
- Describe which evidence occupies the top, middle, bottom, left, center, and right zones when those bands control the composition.

## Major-region hierarchy

Map the few largest visually coherent regions as a major-region hierarchy before local detail. For each, record relative area, tonal or material role, first-attention priority, legibility, and contact with the frame edge. Use source-relative roles such as dominant field, supporting mass, edge frame, or low-legibility zone rather than fixed percentages.

Preserve the hierarchy of region shares even when a flexible pose, viewpoint, or placement changes. Exact coordinates may move while the balance among dominant, supporting, and framing regions remains stable.

## Spatial language

Prefer generator-friendly relations such as `left third`, `near the bottom edge`, `occupies roughly half the frame height`, `touches the left edge`, or `leaves a narrow background band`.

## Relational coordinate frames

- Use frame-relative directions for composition and object- or scene-relative zones for physical relationships.
- Do not let `left`, `right`, `front`, or `behind` stand alone when viewpoint changes could reverse the intended side of a barrier, opening, surface, or container.
- Establish a visible shared reference plane when it disambiguates the scene: floor, ground, seat, platform, tabletop, interior volume, or another support region.
- Record which side of a boundary contains the subject's main mass and which parts, if any, cross, overlap, or remain on the other side.
- Separate apparent 2D overlap from 3D contact, containment, weight support, and depth ordering.
- Prefer a stable natural-language relation over extra coordinates. Coordinates lock placement in the frame but cannot by themselves establish physical topology.

Use normalized coordinates only for concept-critical anchors.

- Use no more than five numeric anchors in a normal prompt.
- Reserve them for seams, screen corners, occluder boundaries, UI bands, reflection joins, replacement zones, or unusual scale relationships that natural language cannot lock clearly.
- Use approximate ranges rather than false precision.
- Do not repeat the same coordinate in prose, negative prompt, and settings.
- When coordinates and natural-language placement disagree, keep the visible relationship and revise or remove the numeric estimate.

## Crop and completion

- Separate hair/head-outline cropping from facial-feature cropping.
- Name which important features remain fully inside the frame and which regions are hidden, occluded, or outside it.
- Preserve unusual headroom, edge bias, negative space, or full-frame scale.
- Prevent a salient face, hand, product, or text mark from being enlarged when that would erase source-visible context.

## Target-size handoff

If settings are requested, report the source frame as metadata and the validated target size separately. Prefer `auto` without a valid deterministic adapter, and disclose ratio-preserving adjustments.

# Included module: `concept.primary-relationship`

# Concept: primary perceptual proposition and relationship

## When to load

Always. Apply deeper spatial analysis to relationship-led occlusion, replacement, reflection, frame-within-frame, miniature, mixed-media, or collage images; do not impose it on ordinary images.

## Core rule

State the primary visual concept and perceptual relationship before inventory details.

Classify the dominant fidelity axis as `relationship-led`, `appearance-led`, `information-led`, or `mixed` before deciding prompt order.

Relationship-led means topology or interaction carries the image; appearance-led means form, surface, light, color, or gestalt survives modest pose variation; information-led means layout, legibility, sequence, or data hierarchy carries it; mixed names two genuinely co-primary axes.

Preserve the side-of-boundary, containment, contact, support, and depth order of concept-critical elements.

## Analysis

Form internally:

1. The visible elements, hierarchy, and primary perceptual proposition: what makes the image itself or compelling, beyond object inventory.
2. Keep the direct appeal reading separate from the render contract: diagnostic language may name the attraction plainly, but generation language must express only its visible causal mechanisms.
3. The dominant fidelity axis and smallest causal cue set.
4. Separate aesthetic invariants from flexible dimensions before drafting. An invariant would materially weaken or change the proposition if altered; a flexible dimension may vary without losing it.
5. Build an invariant salience ledger. Give each invariant a semantic slot, primary or supporting role, observed target, causal origin, source-relative strength, evidence, and one clause owner.
6. For relationship-led or mixed images, the stable zones and each critical pair's side, containment, contact, support, depth, occlusion, and boundary crossing.
7. One to three likely failures, including a category default replacing source-specific evidence.

Build a sparse relation graph and group elements sharing a relation. Keep ordinary premises ordinary. In appearance-led images, do not let minor coordinates outrank appearance; in information-led images, prioritize layout and legibility.

Distinguish image-plane overlap from scene-space containment, contact, and support. When geometry could invert, record contact, weight support, and the relevant boundary or support plane; use object- or scene-relative zones when screen directions are ambiguous.

For special relationships, use this compact Concept Spec:

- Name each concept-critical element, its image-plane role, and its relationship.
- Record join, overlap, contact, containment, hidden or partial regions, boundary side, support, layer order, scale, and coherence ceiling.

## Prompt contribution

Contribute evidence candidates, not guaranteed prose. The central output contract merges candidates by semantic slot and assigns one clause owner. Write a construction recipe, not a prop list; lead with the dominant axis and spend more words on topology only when it is first-order.

Give each major component or coherent group at least one explicit spatial relation to another major component or stable reference zone.

For each concept-critical interaction, write one explicit relation sentence naming both elements, their relevant parts, the side or zone, any contact point, and what provides support when visible.

Normally one to three interaction sentences suffice. Avoid redundant coordinates.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject only likely relationship, completion, normalization, or invariant-demotion drift.


---

# Included module: `core.fidelity-discipline`

# Core: fidelity discipline and anti-normalization

## When to load

Always. Prevent cleaner, more generic, more plausible, or more category-normalized drift.

## Rules

- Cap generated polish to the source. Preserve visible roughness, softness, asymmetry, color cast, retouching level, ordinary capture, and medium imperfections.
- Treat subject attractiveness and image polish as separate controls. A supported attractiveness anchor must not imply cleaner skin, symmetry, makeup, crop, focus, lighting, or editorial finish.
- Preserve visible illusion, mismatch, mixed-media layering, scale incongruity, low fidelity, or awkward capture above plausibility.
- Weaken broad portrait, fashion, garment, product, genre, and body-region labels when they pull toward cleaner styling, expanded crop, completion, or beautification. Put evidence before shorthand.
- Treat source fidelity ceiling as an affirmative requirement: do not exceed visible sharpness, cleanliness, glamour, lighting balance, readability, symmetry, or plausibility unless requested.

## Aesthetic salience gate

Decide whether changing visible form, surface, light, color, or hierarchy while retaining objects would change the image's identity or appeal.

In diagnostic mode, name the source-supported perceptual appeal directly before its visible mechanisms; do not infer motive, identity, or story.

Keep appeal language out of the prompt until translated into bounded controls; evaluation is not an invariant.

Build a sparse Aesthetic Causal Signature from only the form, surface, light-to-form, color, sharpness, and hierarchy axes that materially create the image's perceptual proposition.

- **Form:** silhouette, proportion, contour rhythm, tension, softness, or rigidity.
- **Surface:** texture, finish, translucency, sheen, grain, or processing.
- **Light-to-form:** flattening, soft revelation, separation, or hard sculpture.
- **Color/tone:** palette, cast, saturation, range, and local contrast.
- **Hierarchy:** dominant shapes, material roles, subject/environment balance, and first attention.

Select only causal axes. Use three to six mutually supporting look anchors only when the source aesthetic is high-salience; otherwise use one or two ordinary cues. Describe ambiguity instead of invoking presets.

Treat descriptive detail and rendered sharpness as independent controls. Detail must not raise sharpness, scale, polish, or priority.

Translate evaluative or mood words into visible mechanisms. Use a broad descriptor at most once; it cannot replace causal evidence.

Treat a broad color descriptor as a hypothesis about one causal layer, not as shorthand for hue, value, chroma, lighting, mood, and processing at once. Replace overload with source-supported axes.

Audit prior-heavy cues as a combined cluster, not only as isolated labels. Ignore subject nouns temporarily; rewrite unsupported quality, lighting, surface, framing, or style defaults from evidence without a universal blacklist.

## Prompt additions

State the fidelity ceiling early when the image is casual, degraded, stylized, awkward, or illusion-dependent.

When the source differs from a clean default, place a compact Aesthetic Signature early; add at most one highest-risk boundary.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject only likely beautification, relighting, sharpening, style upgrade, symmetry, scene-normalization, crop, or category-default drift.


---

# Included module: `core.background-color`

# Core: background, color, and environment zoning

## When to load

Always. Every image has background, color, or negative-space structure.

## Rules

- Analyze background zoning as image-plane layers, edge bands, negative space, dark or bright masses, texture, and low-detail regions; preserve their crop positions.
- Preserve background priority. Keep dim, cropped, blurred, hidden, or secondary elements as low-detail massing.
- Treat background legibility and information density as part of the source aesthetic. Named elements inherit source blur, haze, contrast, and detail limits.
- Preserve color mood, cast, saturation, contrast, shadow/highlight color, and local relationships; do not normalize them toward genre defaults.
- Separate intrinsic surface color from illumination color, global color cast or palette shift, exposure or tone curve, and processing. Consolidate each important surface or region into one owned color instruction; other modules may describe how light shifts it but must not restate the same perceptual direction as additional emphasis.
- Keep global cast consistent with the source-visible behavior of multiple regions rather than inferring it from one salient surface. When a global shift is uncertain, preserve relative region relationships instead of forcing a white balance or palette grade.
- Treat a possible neutral reference as evidence only when its low-chroma appearance survives visible illumination, reflection, exposure, clipping, compression, and processing. Record confidence rather than assuming that white, gray, black, or metal is neutral.
- Keep value, chroma, and hue relationships separate. A hierarchy statement may own relative brightness, saturation, area, or contrast, but must not restate a region's intrinsic hue unless hue contrast itself carries the hierarchy.
- In dark, compressed, or hazy areas, distinguish crushed regions from remaining folds, edges, silhouettes, texture, or hints; neither erase nor brightly recover them.
- Prevent clean-room drift: do not replace messy, partial, compressed, or ordinary zones with a tidy backdrop unless visible.

## Prompt additions

Describe zones by position, mass, contrast, legibility, depth, and color behavior before setting labels.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject source-likely cleanup, recovery, invented legibility, removed clutter, added depth, or priority drift.

## Optional settings contribution

- Background, palette/cast, and low-legibility locks:

# Included module: `core.pre-emit-gate`

# Core: pre-emit gate

## When to load

Always. Apply immediately before the final answer.

## Gate

Apply this as a rewrite pass, not a checklist appended to the draft.

### Coverage and ownership

- Confirm that `PROMPT:` contains the primary visual concept, dominant fidelity axis, aesthetic invariants, and every non-negotiable relationship, crop, occlusion, boundary, and medium constraint.
- Merge candidate claims by semantic slot before writing prose; each emitted slot has one clause owner.
- Give every primary invariant one affirmative render control; keep flexible dimensions supporting. Lead with topology for relationship-led, appearance for appearance-led, and layout/legibility for information-led images.

### Net salience

- Audit semantic salience amplification across exact repeats, synonyms, paraphrases, labels, negatives, and settings; a repeatedly described dimension gains visual priority even when no sentence is duplicated verbatim.
- Compare each slot's aggregate direction and strength with its source target. Plausible cues still fail when their combined pull exaggerates an invariant.
- Correct an overstrong draft by replacing or deleting the amplifying language, not by appending a negative counterweight. Keep at most one distinct high-risk boundary per slot.
- Preserve source hierarchy. Check whether a secondary element receives more words than its visible importance supports; compress it when it competes with a primary invariant.
- Audit prior-heavy quality, lighting, surface, framing, and style language as one cluster; rewrite unsupported category defaults from evidence.

### Causal, color, and tone consistency

- Keep form, surface, light-to-form, color, material roles, and hierarchy causally consistent. Do not encode induced effects as intrinsic, and translate direct appeal into observable controls.
- Audit shared perceptual effects across semantic slots, causal layers, paragraphs, negatives, and settings. Slot names being unique does not make repeated value, chroma, hue, or contrast directions independent.
- For a material color or tone effect, verify one aggregate source-relative target and the evidence for every emitted intrinsic, illumination, global-cast, exposure, processing, or hierarchy contribution. Merge or delete a contribution whose causal layer lacks independent evidence.
- Assign every appearance-changing color or tone phrase to one causal layer; treat free-floating mood or color adjectives as unowned claims and rewrite them from observable axes.
- Check global cast against reliable neutral or multi-region evidence; otherwise retain uncertainty and relative relations. Keep hierarchy to area, value, chroma, or contrast unless hue contrast itself is invariant.

### Spatial and fidelity checks

- Audit coordinate contradictions before emitting. Remove conflicting numeric anchors; use at most five unless a dense UI or diagram benefits.
- Relate every major component or coherent group to another component or stable zone. Make inversion-prone side, contact, support, containment, and depth order explicit; distinguish 2D overlap from scene-space contact.
- Preserve the relative area and attention order of major regions. Keep partial or edge-adjacent bodies, garments, objects, reflections, screens, posters, and text blocks incomplete.
- Confirm that detail has not increased subject scale, sharpness, background legibility, retouching, contrast, lighting polish, or a category's default silhouette beyond the source.
- Retain scale-appropriate face evidence: selective likeness anchors when readable, only orientation, hair mass, tone, and visibility when small or obscured.
- Remove unsupported camera, lens, identity, brand, artist, hidden-content, and quality assumptions. Report prompt-only limits honestly for unreliable exact details.

## Length and clarity

- Prefer one concrete statement for a secondary element and add a boundary only for a distinct high-risk failure.
- If the prompt reads as a checklist, rewrite around the proposition, causal cues, and source hierarchy.

# Included module: `core.output-contract`

# Core: adaptive output contract

## When to load

Always. Apply after the visual analysis and routed modules.

## PROMPT

Emit only sections required by the selected output mode.

For a generation request, emit:

```text
PROMPT:
...
```

Write a standalone English prompt ordered by the dominant fidelity axis:

- Begin with frame shape, medium, fidelity ceiling, and the perceptual proposition.
- **Relationship-led:** crop, major zones, topology, interaction, then appearance.
- **Appearance-led:** causal form, surface, light, color, hierarchy, then flexible pose or inventory.
- **Information-led:** layout, reading order, hierarchy, legibility, then decoration.
- **Mixed:** name co-primary invariants and only cues showing their dependency.
- Finish with supporting subject, capture, background, artifact, and drift controls.

Selected modules contribute evidence candidates, not mandatory prose. Merge them by semantic slot; module count must not determine prompt length.

Assign one clause owner to each emitted semantic slot. State its affirmative target once; add only a distinct high-risk boundary.

When color or tone is material, assign each emitted control to one causal layer and one perceptual effect budget. Use source-relative value, chroma, and hue; keep intrinsic surface, illumination, global cast, exposure, processing, and hierarchy consistent.

Place one compact color-tone passage early when primary; when supporting, use the smallest relational control. Hierarchy normally owns area, value, chroma, or contrast, not repeated surface hue.

Use compact blocks for complex images and no fixed word cap; every clause must add a control. Keep essential crop, partial visibility, and interactions affirmative. Relate major components and state inversion-prone topology directly.

For a high-salience look, put one supported Aesthetic Signature before inventory; for a neutral look, use one or two cues. Preserve major-region area, role, edge contact, legibility, and attention.

When face likeness is selected, use one scale-appropriate passage; a gestalt anchor cannot replace visible geometry or raise polish.

## NEGATIVE PROMPT

Emit only when the user requests it or the named generator supports a separate negative-prompt input:

```text
NEGATIVE PROMPT:
...
```

When a negative prompt is supported, reject only likely concept and fidelity drift. Keep it compact; rewrite an overstrong positive instead of countering it with negatives.

## RECOMMENDED SETTINGS

Emit only when requested, when a target generator is known, or when source dimensions require an adapter note:

```text
RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:
- Model:
- Source frame:
- Target size:
- Quality:
- Prompt-only limits:
```

Include only real generator controls. Separate source dimensions from the requested target size, read `references/model-adapters.md`, and keep visual locks in `PROMPT:`.

## Diagnostic mode

For `diagnostic`, state the source-supported proposition, then its visible causal mechanisms. Keep diagnostic appeal language separate from render instructions, distinguish invariants from flexible dimensions, and include a prompt only when useful.

## Final rule

Read `PROMPT:` as if the source image and every optional section disappeared. If the primary proposition, its invariants, crop, required relationship, subject hierarchy, medium, or fidelity ceiling would be lost, revise the prompt itself.

# Included module: `concept.screen-frame-within-frame`

# Concept: screen, poster, and frame-within-frame

## When to load

Load when a visible screen, poster, print, photograph, frame, UI preview, window, or picture plane contains important content, or when that plane completes/replaces another visible subject.

## Detection cues

- Rectangular plane with its own content and edges.
- Secondary face/object/scene inside a screen, poster, reflection, or frame.
- Contained content differs in medium, scale, sharpness, brightness, or perspective from the surrounding scene.
- The contained layer is partial or low-legibility.

## Prompt additions

- Separate canvas orientation from object orientation. For each major rectangle, state its long edge, short edge, corner order, and image-plane rotation.
- Lock the container's corner coordinates, border thickness, rotation, perspective skew, crop, and image-plane area.
- Describe contained content as contained content, not as an in-world object unless it visibly is one.
- State visible fragments inside the container and absent counterpart fragments.
- Preserve medium contrast: screen glow, print flatness, poster grain, frame border, glass glare, UI preview softness, or low-resolution contained image.
- If the screen/frame replaces hidden subject features, combine with `concept.occlusion-replacement` and state replacement logic explicitly.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject turning screen/poster content into a real physical subject; full second scene; complete body/object when only a fragment is visible; wrong rectangle rotation; flattening a diagonal screen upright; removing borders; adding full app chrome or clean product-screen UI when absent.

## Optional settings contribution

- Perceptual relationship locks: contained layer remains within the frame/screen/poster.
- Coordinate and anchor locks: container corners, border, rotation, and content crop.
- Coherence/realism ceiling locks: preserve mixed layer or screen-contained reading.

# Included module: `medium.screenshot-ui`

# Medium: screenshot, app, and social-video UI fidelity

## When to load

Load when the source is or includes a screenshot, screen recording, social-video frame, camera preview, app capture, or any UI overlay.

## Detection cues

- status bar/time/battery icons
- top or bottom app chrome
- comment/input field
- player controls, scrub bars, crop marks, camera preview controls
- reaction buttons, profile icons, side action stack, captions, subtitles, watermarks
- transparent icons floating over image content

## Prompt additions

- Audit the exact UI/content split before emitting.
- Do not invent absent UI controls.
- Treat UI overlays as composition-critical image-plane bands, not decorative afterthoughts.
- Lock exact UI/content split: y-start, height, opacity, corner radius, text size, icon size, edge distance, and whether overlays sit on transparent background or a solid/semitransparent band.
- Distinguish transparent overlay icons from app chrome bands. If top icons float over video/background with no black rectangle, say so and reject a black status/header bar.
- State which controls are present and which common controls are absent, so the generator does not add default social UI.
- Preserve overlay restraint. If the source has only a simple status bar, one bottom field, one crop mark, or one ambiguous control, do not invite a full modern app interface.
- For tiny UI marks, combine with `detail.text-logo-label` and keep low-legibility.
- If a short progress line or edge mark exists, preserve observed length and discontinuity. Do not call it a full progress bar unless visible.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject home indicators, heart/reaction buttons, share buttons, profile avatars, side action stacks, progress bars, captions, subtitles, top app chrome, branded headers, enlarged UI controls, black top bars, full app interface, random UI icons, clean typography, full-width timeline tracks, and scrub knobs unless actually visible.

## Optional settings contribution

- UI/text/label locks when relevant:
- Boundary and visibility-budget locks: UI bands and absent controls.
- Coordinate and anchor locks: overlay y-starts, heights, edge distances, and opacity.

# Included module: `subject.generic-object`

# Subject: generic object or ordinary scene fallback

## When to load

Load when no specific subject module fits, but the router still needs a subject decision for an ordinary object, partial prop, abstract surface, empty scene, or visually simple arrangement.

## Rules

- When no specific subject module fits, preserve the main visible object or ordinary scene as a generic object/scene without inventing a category.
- Describe image-plane role, position, scale, crop, material, color, occlusion, edge contact, and visibility level before naming a broad object category.
- If the subject is absent, abstract, mostly background, or only a partial edge element, say so and avoid promoting it into a central object.
- Do not add a person, product, animal, vehicle, document, architecture, landscape, food, or brand category just to make the prompt sound complete.

## Prompt additions

Use direct visible descriptions such as `ordinary partial object`, `simple cropped surface`, `abstract/ambiguous foreground shape`, or `mostly empty scene` when that is more faithful than a category label.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject invented categories, added subjects, object completion, product-shot conversion, and subject centralization that is not visible.

## Optional settings contribution

- Generic subject fallback locks:

# Included module: `detail.color-tone-fidelity`

# Detail: color and tone fidelity

## When to load

Load only when color or tonal behavior is a primary or supporting invariant, the user explicitly asks for tone fidelity, or a likely causal mix-up could materially change the image. Do not load merely because an image contains color.

## Color/Tone Contract

Build a source-relative Color/Tone Contract only when color or tonal behavior materially carries fidelity.

For each important region, record only observable evidence:

- separate value or lightness, chroma or saturation, and hue family or undertone
- identify the region's visual role and source-visible relation to another region
- distinguish intrinsic surface behavior from illumination, global cast or palette shift, exposure or tone curve, and processing
- record confidence and uncertainty instead of inventing a missing color cause

Assign every material color or tone observation to intrinsic surface, illumination, global cast or palette shift, exposure or tone curve, or processing.

Describe important regions through separate value, chroma, and hue observations plus source-visible relations to other regions. Do not let one broad adjective silently determine all three axes.

Map highlight, midtone, shadow, or flat-field behavior only at the granularity the source supports. A flat graphic need not acquire photographic tone zones, and a clipped, compressed, mixed-light, or low-legibility region must retain that uncertainty.

## Calibration evidence

Treat a possible neutral as a calibration anchor only with visible evidence and an explicit confidence level. A white, gray, black, metallic, or low-chroma region may still be shifted by colored illumination, reflection, exposure, clipping, compression, or grading.

When no reliable neutral exists, preserve relative color relationships and mark global-cast uncertainty rather than inventing a white balance. In photographs, translate a supported global cast into white-balance or capture language; in non-photographic work, treat it as a palette or rendering shift.

Use more than one representative patch when measurement tools are available and tone is first-order. Prefer robust region summaries over a single pixel. Inspect embedded color-profile status, and disclose any assumed display space or missing profile.

For an exact local file, the optional probe accepts analyst-selected normalized regions and never chooses semantic targets itself:

```bash
python tools/color_probe.py IMAGE --region name=x0,y0,x1,y1
python tools/color_probe.py SOURCE --region name=x0,y0,x1,y1 \
  --compare RENDER --compare-region name=x0,y0,x1,y1
```

Use matching region names for comparison. Select bounds from visible evidence and keep differently posed or cropped images on independently chosen bounds.

Use measurements as diagnostic evidence, never as automatic prompt wording or proof of intrinsic color. Exact RGB, hex, Lab, or temperature values should not enter a production prompt unless the downstream generator genuinely supports them and the source evidence justifies that precision.

## Cross-layer effect budget

Merge color and tone claims by their shared perceptual effect across causal layers, not only by semantic-slot name.

Give material effects a canonical source-relative effect identifier covering the affected region, perceptual axis, direction, and aggregate strength. If intrinsic color, illumination, global cast, exposure, processing, or hierarchy all push the same region in the same direction, require independent evidence for each layer and judge their combined pull against one aggregate target.

- Merge unsupported repetition into one owned control.
- Preserve genuinely multi-layer color only when the source supports every layer and their aggregate result.
- Let hierarchy own relative area, value, chroma, or contrast. It may own hue only when hue contrast itself is an invariant; it must not repeat another region's intrinsic hue for emphasis.
- Treat free-floating color or mood words as unowned until assigned to one causal layer.

## Evidence contribution

When color or tone is primary, contribute one compact causal signature before flexible pose or inventory. Normally cover the dominant region's intrinsic value/chroma/hue, the supported light or global shift, and its highlight-to-shadow or flat-field response without repeating a direction.

When color is supporting, contribute only the smallest relational cue needed to preserve it. Use one source-likely drift boundary only when replacing or merging the affirmative wording does not already control the risk.

## Diagnostic mode

State whether the observed difference is principally intrinsic color, illumination, global cast, exposure or tone curve, processing, or an unresolved combination. Keep profile and measurement uncertainty separate from visual judgment.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject only source-likely drift in relative value, chroma, hue direction, global cast, exposure response, tone-zone behavior, or unsupported uniform grading. Do not install fixed color-word blacklists or example-specific desired values.

# Included module: `detail.low-quality-artifacts`

# Detail: low-quality, compression, blur, and artifact fidelity

## When to load

Load when degraded capture quality is visually important or when a generator is likely to over-polish the image.

## Detection cues

- compression blocks, social-media softness, small image upscaling, smeared edges
- low-light noise, chroma noise, crushed shadows, clipped highlights
- motion blur, camera shake, rolling-shutter smear
- haze, bloom, low contrast, sharpening halos, noise reduction plasticity
- low-legibility text or background due to resolution

## Prompt additions

- Put fidelity ceiling near the beginning of `PROMPT:` when degradation controls the look.
- State relative focus hierarchy: what is least soft, what is heavily blurred, what remains indistinct.
- Calibrate underexposure. Distinguish fully crushed black regions from dark low-contrast regions that still show folds, edges, face planes, object silhouettes, or background detail.
- Preserve haze, softness, noise, compression, and low-detail edges. Do not request `crisp`, `pristine`, `sharp`, `clean`, or `high quality` unless the source is actually clean.
- Mention artifact distribution: edges, shadows, flat color areas, UI bands, background, skin/hair, text, motion direction.
- For phone-video, screenshots, social-media captures, or compressed casual sources, promote visible imperfections into positive prompt constraints before any aesthetic or material polish. Name low-resolution edge softness, compression smearing, motion-soft groups, flattened background massing, haze, bloom, clipped highlights, low-legibility marks, and sensor/app artifacts when visible.
- Treat distant or secondary background elements in degraded captures as massing and artifact planes before category labels. Lock them as blurred, low-legibility, compressed, partially cropped, or secondary unless the source clearly makes them the subject.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject over-sharpening, clean studio quality, HDR upgrade, noise removal, plastic smoothing, brightening shadows into invented detail, erasing compression, perfect focus, clean text, detailed background, polished render, and making the image more cinematic or commercial than the source.

## Optional settings contribution

- Quality/Fidelity: degraded/soft/compressed/noisy/hazy/underexposed as visible.
- Focus and depth-of-field locks: relative focus hierarchy.
- Film/camera/sensor or medium artifact locks: artifact types and distribution.

# Included module: `detail.text-logo-label`

# Detail: text, logos, labels, watermarks, and tiny marks

## When to load

Load when text, label marks, logo-like marks, signs, watermarks, UI text, chart labels, document text, or small graphic marks are visible.

## Prompt additions

- Preserve location, size, contrast, and readability level before exact transcription.
- Preserve location, size, contrast, orientation, perspective, opacity, softness, and readability level over exact transcription unless exact readable text is central.
- If text is small, partial, distorted, reflected, low-confidence, compressed, or secondary, describe it as low-legibility marks, faint letters, short word-like fragments, label blocks, or abstract marks.
- If incidental text is clearly readable despite being small, preserve exact visible characters and low-legibility rendering together. Do not let exact text become clean hero typography.
- For watermarks, product labels, package labels, background signs, reflected marks, engraved marks, and decorative monograms, distinguish text-plane role from exact content.
- Do not identify brands externally. Treat brand-like marks as visible graphic/text evidence unless the user explicitly asks for brand recognition and policy allows it.
- For UI text, combine with `medium.screenshot-ui` and preserve small size, opacity, and placement.
- For charts/documents, combine with `subject.document-data-diagram` and preserve layout before text content.
- For tiny ambiguous UI marks, cropped controls, small badges, or low-confidence symbols, preserve position, size, opacity, edge distance, and ambiguity over exact icon identity. If the internal mark is unclear, call it an abstract or low-legibility mark rather than a named icon, logo, app control, or readable symbol.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject random letters, invented words, crisp typography, enlarged text, prominent logo creation, readable brand marks, substituted times/numbers/labels, full captions, clean subtitles, extra watermarks, and exact text over-prioritized at the expense of placement and softness.

## Optional settings contribution

- UI/text/label locks when relevant: exact or low-legibility text, mark coordinates, size, contrast, and readability ceiling.
- Boundary and visibility-budget locks: small marks stay small and secondary.

# Optional model adapter reference

Apply only the section for the named downstream generator.

# Model adapters

Read only the adapter for the named downstream generator. If no generator is named, keep settings generator-agnostic and do not invent unsupported controls.

## GPT Image 2

Official references:

- https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation#customize-image-output
- https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/multimodal/image-gen-models-prompting-guide#2-prompting-fundamentals

### Prompt

- Use a skimmable order: scene/background, subject, key details, constraints.
- Use short labeled segments or line breaks for complex prompts.
- Describe framing, viewpoint, placement, interaction, medium, lighting, and only the quality cues that matter.
- Treat detailed camera specifications as high-level visual cues, not exact physical simulation.
- Put essential exclusions and invariants in the main prompt. The official Image API output controls do not document a separate negative-prompt field.

### Settings

Use only documented controls that are relevant:

- `model: gpt-image-2`
- `size: auto` or a valid custom size
- `quality: low | medium | high | auto`
- `output_format: png | jpeg | webp`
- `output_compression: 0-100` for JPEG or WebP
- `background: auto | opaque`

Do not request a transparent background for GPT Image 2.

### Custom-size constraints

A custom size is valid only when:

- both edges are multiples of 16 pixels
- the maximum edge is at most 3840 pixels
- long-edge to short-edge ratio is at most 3:1
- total pixels are between 655,360 and 8,294,400 inclusive

Keep `Source frame` and `Target size` separate. When source dimensions are invalid, run:

```bash
python3 tools/size_adapter.py WIDTH HEIGHT
```

Use its target size or choose `auto`. State that the target is a ratio-preserving adapter size, not the source file dimensions.

## Other generators

- Emit `NEGATIVE PROMPT:` only when the downstream tool exposes a separate negative-prompt input or the user explicitly requests a reusable negative list.
- Use natural-language zones by default. Emit numeric coordinates only if the tool has a compatible layout/control surface or the concept depends on a small number of boundaries.
- Do not name sampler, scheduler, guidance, seed, steps, or control inputs unless the named tool actually supports them.
