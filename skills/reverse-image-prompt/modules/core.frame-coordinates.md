# Core: frame, crop, and spatial anchors

## When to load

Always.

## Source frame

- Inspect the exact file dimensions when available and record them internally as source metadata.
- Treat aspect-ratio drift as a major fidelity failure.
- Separate source dimensions from the requested target size. Never assume the source pixel dimensions are accepted by the target generator.
- Preserve the measured ratio in plain language such as `narrow portrait`, `wide landscape`, or `source-specific portrait ratio`; add a decimal ratio only when it helps distinguish nearby shapes.
- Do not invent exact dimensions from a viewer preview.
- Put frame shape, crop, subject scale, and edge interactions before small object detail.
- Lock subject frame share and negative-space share before adding face or object micro-detail.
- Describe which evidence occupies the frame zones, including any material source-visible axis offset.

## Major-region hierarchy

Map the few largest visually coherent regions as a major-region hierarchy before local detail. Record relative area, role, attention, legibility, and frame contact without fixed percentages.

Preserve region-share hierarchy when flexible pose, viewpoint, or placement changes; exact coordinates may move.

## Spatial language

Before drafting, give each material placement, principal axis, viewpoint, and cross-component dimension a direction-neutral disposition. Placement never proves orientation; require separate axis, side-visibility, occlusion, depth-order, silhouette, or perspective cues. Centered may be oblique and offset may be frontal.

## Relational coordinate frames

- Use frame-relative directions for composition and object- or scene-relative zones for physical relationships.
- Do not let `left`, `right`, `front`, or `behind` stand alone when viewpoint changes could reverse the intended side of a barrier, opening, surface, or container.
- Establish a visible shared reference plane when it disambiguates the scene: floor, ground, seat, platform, tabletop, interior volume, or another support region.
- Record which side of a boundary contains the subject's main mass and which parts, if any, cross, overlap, or remain on the other side.
- Separate apparent 2D overlap from 3D contact, containment, weight support, and depth ordering.
- Prefer a stable natural-language relation over extra coordinates. Coordinates lock placement in the frame but cannot by themselves establish physical topology.

Use normalized coordinates only for concept-critical anchors.

- Use no more than five numeric anchors in a normal prompt.
- Reserve them for seams, screen corners, occluder boundaries, UI bands, reflection joins, replacement zones, or unusual scale relationships that natural language cannot lock clearly.
- Use approximate ranges rather than false precision.
- Do not repeat the same coordinate in prose, negative prompt, and settings.
- When coordinates and natural-language placement disagree, keep the visible relationship and revise or remove the numeric estimate.

## Crop and completion

- Separate hair/head-outline cropping from facial-feature cropping.
- Name which important features remain fully inside the frame and which regions are hidden, occluded, or outside it.
- Preserve unusual headroom, edge bias, negative space, or full-frame scale.
- Prevent a salient face, hand, product, or text mark from being enlarged when that would erase source-visible context.

## Target-size handoff

If settings are requested, report the source frame as metadata and the validated target size separately. Prefer `auto` without a valid deterministic adapter, and disclose ratio-preserving adjustments.
