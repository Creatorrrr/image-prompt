# Detail: text, logos, labels, watermarks, and tiny marks

## When to load

Load when text, label marks, logo-like marks, signs, watermarks, UI text, chart labels, document text, or small graphic marks are visible.

## Prompt additions

- Preserve location, size, contrast, orientation, perspective, opacity, softness, and readability level over exact transcription unless exact readable text is central.
- If text is small, partial, distorted, reflected, low-confidence, compressed, or secondary, describe it as low-legibility marks, faint letters, short word-like fragments, label blocks, or abstract marks.
- If incidental text is clearly readable despite being small, preserve exact visible characters and low-legibility rendering together. Do not let exact text become clean hero typography.
- For watermarks, product labels, package labels, background signs, reflected marks, engraved marks, and decorative monograms, distinguish text-plane role from exact content.
- Do not identify brands externally. Treat brand-like marks as visible graphic/text evidence unless the user explicitly asks for brand recognition and policy allows it.
- For UI text, combine with `medium.screenshot-ui` and preserve small size, opacity, and placement.
- For charts/documents, combine with `subject.document-data-diagram` and preserve layout before text content.
- For tiny ambiguous UI marks, cropped controls, small badges, or low-confidence symbols, preserve position, size, opacity, edge distance, and ambiguity over exact icon identity. If the internal mark is unclear, call it an abstract or low-legibility mark rather than a named icon, logo, app control, or readable symbol.

## Negative additions

Reject random letters, invented words, crisp typography, enlarged text, prominent logo creation, readable brand marks, substituted times/numbers/labels, full captions, clean subtitles, extra watermarks, and exact text over-prioritized at the expense of placement and softness.

## Settings additions

- UI/text/label locks when relevant: exact or low-legibility text, mark coordinates, size, contrast, and readability ceiling.
- Boundary and visibility-budget locks: small marks stay small and secondary.

# Legacy monolith fidelity rules preserved verbatim

These excerpts are normative. They preserve detailed anti-drift behavior from `legacy/SKILL.monolith.original.md`; do not weaken them when applying this module.


## Legacy text, mark, UI, watermark, label, and low-legibility rules


When a body area or garment gap is only a thin bottom-edge or side-edge sliver, avoid making it sound like a subject. Prefer wording such as `a narrow edge band/gap remains at the crop boundary`, `a thin skin-toned edge strip`, or `a barely visible cropped gap` over labels such as `visible abdomen`, `visible midriff`, or `visible waist` unless that area is actually central and materially visible. If a prompt uses a body-part label for a sliver, immediately qualify that it is not a subject region and should not expand inward.

If the source garment is cropped near the bottom and a broad clothing category such as `crop top` would invite a fashion-style exposed abdomen composition, describe the visible hem and frame cut first, and use the category label only as secondary shorthand or omit it when the hem/crop is the important evidence. Never let bottom-edge garment wording imply that the lower body should be completed or that a larger skin band should be centered.

For small text marks, logos, labels, signatures, UI text, or incidental lettering, preserve location, size, contrast, and readability level over exact transcription unless the exact readable text is central to the image. If it is small, partial, distorted, or low confidence, describe it as an indistinct mark and prevent the generator from enlarging it or turning it into prominent clean typography.

For watermarks, product labels, package labels, background signs, reflected marks, engraved marks, and decorative monograms in photographic scenes, distinguish text-plane role from exact text content. If the mark is secondary, soft, transparent, curved, reflected, low-resolution, or partially legible, write it as a faint graphic or label artifact with approximate placement and legibility ceiling. Do not over-transcribe low-confidence letters in `PROMPT:` unless exact readability is central; over-transcription often makes generators create a crisp logo, clean sign, or new prominent text object.

For incidental text that is visible but compressed or small, lock it as low-legibility. Do not request crisp typography unless the source clearly centers readable text as the subject.

When incidental UI text is clearly readable despite being small, preserve the exact visible characters and their low-legibility rendering together. Do not let the generator substitute a plausible different time, placeholder, number, brand, or label. Exact text locks should still emphasize small size, soft edges, and secondary priority, not clean typography.

When incidental text is near a garment or object edge, describe it as a small, soft mark anchored to that edge. Avoid repeating the exact text in ways that make the model prioritize clean lettering over edge placement, size, softness, and low contrast.

For incidental interface overlays, screenshot controls, camera controls, reaction marks, low-confidence symbols, small badges, or cropped graphic marks, preserve them as low-legibility artifacts unless their exact symbol is central and clearly readable. Describe approximate shape, size, opacity, edge distance, internal contrast, and ambiguity. If the internal mark is unclear, call it an abstract mark rather than a named icon, arrow, logo, or app control. Reject conversion into clean readable typography, a brand mark, a watermark, a caption, or an enlarged interface element.

For progress lines, scrub bars, separators, or edge slivers, preserve the observed length and discontinuity. If the source shows only a tiny partial line at an edge or a short pale segment, do not describe it as a full progress bar; explicitly reject full-width bars, timeline tracks, knobs, home indicators, or completed app controls unless they are visible.

For ambiguous tiny UI edge marks that are not central to recognition, do not over-promote them in `PROMPT:`. It is safer to say that no full progress bar or timeline is visible than to positively request a mark that may expand into a complete control. Mention the tiny mark only as a cropped edge artifact when it is visually clear and bounded.

For secondary objects such as bags, straps, jewelry, tools, handheld items, furniture fragments, signs, UI controls, props, or cropped products, create a secondary-object budget. Lock edge distance, bounding box, overlap with the primary subject or containing surface, visible crop, occlusion, and relative size against nearby body, object, frame, or background anchors. If the object is secondary or edge-adjacent in the source, describe it as partial, tucked, compressed, low-priority, obscured, or low-detail as supported by evidence; prevent it from becoming larger, cleaner, front-facing, product-like, fully readable, or more central than the source.

Identify completion-prone regions before drafting: partially cropped bodies, partial garments, partial faces, partial text, partial posters/screens/reflections, cut-off limbs, and border-adjacent areas. In `PROMPT:`, lock each such region as partial or cropped; in `NEGATIVE PROMPT:`, reject completing, recentering, expanding, or clarifying those regions.
