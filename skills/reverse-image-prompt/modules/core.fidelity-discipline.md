# Core: fidelity discipline and anti-normalization

## When to load

Always. Prevent cleaner, more generic, more plausible, or more category-normalized drift.

## Rules

- Cap generated polish to the source. Preserve visible roughness, softness, asymmetry, color cast, retouching level, ordinary capture, and medium imperfections.
- Treat subject attractiveness and image polish as separate controls. A supported attractiveness anchor must not imply cleaner skin, symmetry, makeup, crop, focus, lighting, or editorial finish.
- Preserve visible illusion, mismatch, mixed-media layering, scale incongruity, low fidelity, or awkward capture above plausibility.
- Weaken broad portrait, fashion, garment, product, genre, and body-region labels when they pull toward cleaner styling, expanded crop, completion, or beautification. Put evidence before shorthand.
- Treat source fidelity ceiling as an affirmative requirement: do not exceed visible sharpness, cleanliness, glamour, lighting balance, readability, symmetry, or plausibility unless requested.

## Aesthetic salience gate

Decide whether changing visible form, surface, light, color, or hierarchy while retaining objects would change the image's identity or appeal.

In diagnostic mode, name the source-supported perceptual appeal directly before its visible mechanisms; do not infer motive, identity, or story.

Keep appeal language out of the prompt until translated into bounded controls; evaluation is not an invariant.

Build a sparse Aesthetic Causal Signature from only the form, surface, light-to-form, color, sharpness, and hierarchy axes that materially create the image's perceptual proposition.

- **Form:** silhouette, proportion, contour rhythm, tension, softness, or rigidity.
- **Surface:** texture, finish, translucency, sheen, grain, or processing.
- **Light-to-form:** flattening, soft revelation, separation, or hard sculpture.
- **Color/tone:** palette, cast, saturation, range, and local contrast.
- **Hierarchy:** dominant shapes, material roles, subject/environment balance, and first attention.

Select only causal axes. Use three to six mutually supporting look anchors only when the source aesthetic is high-salience; otherwise use one or two ordinary cues. Describe ambiguity instead of invoking presets.

Treat descriptive detail and rendered sharpness as independent controls. Detail must not raise sharpness, scale, polish, or priority.

Translate evaluative or mood words into visible mechanisms. Use a broad descriptor at most once; it cannot replace causal evidence.

Treat a broad color descriptor as a hypothesis about one causal layer, not as shorthand for hue, value, chroma, lighting, mood, and processing at once. Replace overload with source-supported axes.

Decompose an appearance metaphor into observable color axes, surface behavior, and illumination before using it as a non-directional summary. A metaphor may summarize resolved evidence once; it must not add a second color, gloss, softness, luminosity, or grading instruction.

Audit prior-heavy cues as a combined cluster, not only as isolated labels. Ignore subject nouns temporarily; rewrite unsupported quality, lighting, surface, framing, or style defaults from evidence without a universal blacklist.

## Prompt additions

State the fidelity ceiling early when the image is casual, degraded, stylized, awkward, or illusion-dependent.

When the source differs from a clean default, place a compact Aesthetic Signature early; add at most one highest-risk boundary.

## Optional negative contribution

Reject only likely beautification, relighting, sharpening, style upgrade, symmetry, scene-normalization, crop, or category-default drift.
